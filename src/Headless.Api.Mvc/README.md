# Headless.Api.Mvc

Framework integration for ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API with controllers, filters, JSON configuration, and common utilities.

## Why use this package

Provides consistent MVC configuration, base controllers, and URL canonicalization for traditional controller-based APIs. Exception-to-ProblemDetails mapping is handled globally by `Headless.Api.Core`'s `HeadlessApiExceptionHandler` (registered via `AddHeadlessProblemDetails()`), so MVC actions get the same response shape as Minimal-API endpoints.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Headless.Api.Mvc
```
