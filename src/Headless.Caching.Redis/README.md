# Headless.Caching.Redis

Redis distributed cache implementation for multi-instance applications.

## Problem Solved

Provides distributed caching using Redis via the unified `ICache` abstraction, enabling cache sharing across multiple application instances.

## Key Features

- Full `IRemoteCache` implementation using StackExchange.Redis
- Supports strongly-typed `IRemoteCache<T>` pattern
- Prefix-based key management
- Atomic operations (increment, compare-and-swap, SetIfHigher/Lower)
- Set/list operations with pagination
- Lua scripts for atomic multi-key operations
- Redis Cluster support

## Design Notes

Scalar write operations (`UpsertAsync`, `TryInsertAsync`, `TryReplaceAsync`, `TryReplaceIfEqualAsync`, `UpsertAllAsync`) store entries as a versioned binary envelope: a 19-byte base header followed by an optional 8-byte sliding-expiration field and the raw value segment produced by the cache value codec. The header starts with magic/version bytes `0xFF 0x01`, then flags, then logical and physical expiration timestamps encoded as little-endian Unix milliseconds. Physical expiration is mapped to the Redis key TTL when fail-safe is enabled, so Redis retains the key until physical expiration even after logical expiration has passed. Sliding expiration maps the key TTL to the idle deadline and keeps physical expiration in the envelope as the absolute cap. Atomic counters (`Increment`, `SetIfHigher`, `SetIfLower`) bypass framing and write raw Redis-native numeric strings (see below).

The envelope byte layout is:

| Offset | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Magic | `0xFF` — marks a framed entry |
| 1 | Version | `0x01` — current envelope version |
| 2 | Flags | bit0 = `isNull`, bit1 = `hasLogicalExpiresAt`, bit2 = `hasPhysicalExpiresAt`, bit3 = `hasSlidingExpiration` |
| 3–10 | LogicalExpiresAt | `Int64` little-endian Unix milliseconds (present only when bit1 is set) |
| 11–18 | PhysicalExpiresAt | `Int64` little-endian Unix milliseconds (present only when bit2 is set) |
| 19–26 | SlidingExpiration | `Int64` little-endian milliseconds (present only when bit3 is set) |
| 19+ or 27+ | ValueSegment | raw codec bytes; offset is 27 when bit3 is set, otherwise 19; empty when `isNull` is set |

Null scalar values are represented by a header flag with an empty value segment. The literal string `"@@NULL"` is now a normal cacheable string when written through Redis cache APIs. Raw legacy keys containing `"@@NULL"` still read as null. Atomic counters (`Increment`, `SetIfHigher`, `SetIfLower`) remain raw Redis-native numeric strings so Redis can perform native atomic arithmetic; their read path falls back to the raw value codec.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Headless.Caching.Redis
```

## Quick Start

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var redis = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost:6379");

builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConnectionMultiplexer>(redis);

builder.Services.AddRedisCache(options =>
{
    options.ConnectionMultiplexer = redis;
    options.KeyPrefix = "myapp:";
});
```

## Configuration

### Options

```csharp
options.ConnectionMultiplexer = multiplexer;
options.KeyPrefix = "myapp:";
```

## Cancellation Token Behavior

Cancellation is checked **at the start** of each operation. Once an operation begins, it completes without interruption:

| Operation Type | Cancellation Behavior |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Single-key ops (`GetAsync`, `UpsertAsync`, etc.) | Checked before Redis call; operation completes atomically |
| Batch ops (`UpsertAllAsync`, `RemoveAllAsync`) | Checked before batch starts; all keys processed atomically |
| SCAN-based ops (`RemoveByPrefixAsync`, `GetAllKeysByPrefixAsync`) | Cancellable during iteration (unbounded key sets) |

This design ensures consumers never observe partial results from batch operations.

> **Note:** StackExchange.Redis doesn't support `CancellationToken` in its API. Timeouts are configured via `ConfigurationOptions.SyncTimeout` and `AsyncTimeout`.

## Dependencies

- `Headless.Caching.Abstractions`
- `Headless.Caching.Core`
- `Headless.Hosting`
- `Headless.Redis`
- `Headless.Serializer.Json`
- `StackExchange.Redis`

## Side Effects

- Registers `IRemoteCache` as singleton
- Registers `IRemoteCache<T>` as singleton
- Registers a keyed `HeadlessRedisScriptsLoader` bound to `RedisCacheOptions.ConnectionMultiplexer`
- Registers a hosted `IInitializer` that warms Redis cache Lua scripts on host start
- Uses existing `IConnectionMultiplexer` if registered, otherwise creates one
