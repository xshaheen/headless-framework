## ✨ Key Features

-   ⚙️ **Unopinionated Design**
    Use your own patterns and architectures — the framework stays out of your way.

-   🔄 **Supports Most Flows**
    Built to integrate seamlessly with real-world use cases: CRUD, CQRS, messaging, file uploads, and more.

-   🧱 **Composable & Modular**
    Pick only what you need. Each piece is a standalone NuGet package or service.

-   📦 **Zero Lock-in**
    Use with any storage, any frontend, any transport (REST, gRPC, GraphQL, etc.).

-   🧠 **Developer-Centric**
    Designed with clean architecture support, vertical slice support, CQRS, extensibility, and **performance** in mind.

-   ✅ **No Magic, Just Code**
    Everything is **explicit**. No hidden conventions or forced scaffolding.

---

## 🚀 Ideal For .NET Developers Who:

-   Prefer flexibility over convention
-   Want to bootstrap quickly but scale cleanly
-   Care about performance, testability, and maintainability
